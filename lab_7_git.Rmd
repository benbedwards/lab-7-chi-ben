We are asking; is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder or the same difficulty to get)?

Are we wine tasting tomorrow?

Ben: Data wrangling and counts

```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>%
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% 
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male")
```
